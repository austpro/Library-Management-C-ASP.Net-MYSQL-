We have built a Desktop application for Library management system.  We have created a database 
for maintaining their records of  students, books, and other services.There will be an admin 
who can insert, delete and update the information. So these are the features we have done in this system:
•	Manage the complete management of the entire library through the software’s easy interface.
•	It removes manual process of issuing books by easy and simplified way of issuing book saving time and effort.
•	The librarian can issue, return and reserve book for a particular student through the software’s interface.
•	The software automatically shows fine levied by automatically counting days from the date 
        if issue in case of late return of the book.
•	Add, update, search and view library items.
•	Generate customized report for library items, library inventory and library fine collection.
